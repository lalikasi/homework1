What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

When looking at the history of the branches and master branch, rebase will 
remove unwanted entries, keeping only what's necessary or any changes 
made. This will reduce the history, ultimately "flattening" it. Git merge 
will only look at the branch that was targeted and preserves the history 
of the source branch and all entries made.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is one where there are several versions of the project 
that are not hosted locally. Instead, they are hosted on the Internet or 
another external network. This allows for access to a larger team as it's 
hosted on a server.
